Long ago in Italy there lived on old clock-maker named Geppetto. 
Tick-tick-TOCK! Tick-tick-TOCK! went all the clocks in his shop.
When he worked, Geppetto felt happy. But when he rested, a sad feeling came over him. “Ah!” he would think.
“All my life and no child to call my own!”
One day Geppetto carved a puppet from wood in the shape of a boy. 
The arms and legs could move.
He cut and sewed a nice outfit for the puppet, as if it were a real boy.
"I will call you Pinocchio," said Geppetto.
That night, Geppetto lay the wooden puppet down onto the bed.
From out of the window, a big star twinkled bright.
Geppetto looked out the window to the twinkling star.  
“Bright star,” said Geppetto.
“If I could make one wish, it would be that I could have a real boy of my own.”
 But of course, he knew that was not possible.
